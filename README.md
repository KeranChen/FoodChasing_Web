A Start of Food Adventure  

Website Objective:

     This website answers the question: Where to go for food today? 
  
     Residing in their perfect little babbles, most of people nowadays visit the same few restaurants for a bit too often. The reasons might be three-fold: the frustration that few restaurants match their individual preferences, the hesitation that arises due to the lack of visual presentations of the actual foods the restaurants serve, or the scare due to too many choices. This website aims to solve this problem by generating a single restaurant choice everytime for users with images of the foods there, given the individualized preferences from the users. 
     
      On the homepage of the website, users can fill out a form of their particular dining preferences, such as the type of cuisine, their location, price-range. Then, the website returns a random restaurant, with very descriptive images of the food of the restaurants based on the user’s preferences. If the users didn’t fall for this restaurant, they can choose “next”, which generates another restaurant, based on the preference sheet they have filled out earlier.  This main function of this website will be achieved by using Yelp API, which gives us the results that can match our queries, and the links to images of the food that people post on Yelp.

       The individual preferences of restaurants could also be derived from a list of restaurants the users regularly visit. Hence, another feature of our website could be allowing the users to type in several restaurants they love, and the website will generate a restaurant based on their favorite list. This feature should also support the “next” function. This function can also be achieved through Yelp API. 

      After choosing the restaurant, if the users what to go for that place, there will also be a reservation page for booking a table on our website. This feature may just be a demo feature in this project so far, but realizing this demo page can expand the functionality of this website, and give us some ideas of what’s our next step can be in developing this website. 

User needs:

     In short, this website is for the adventurous but lazy people.

     As stated above, this website aims to give people an incentive and courage to go out of their comfort zones for food adventures. Hence, the type of people we are targeting are the people who are image-driven, love dining out, adventurous, ready to try some new restaurants, but are too lazy or too busy to do restaurants searching. 

     The reason why users might need this website is that: the regular online restaurants searching can make the users end up with too many choices that can actually hinge them from making an intuitive choice (decide-phobia), and usually the images of the actual foods are hidden behind several clicks. Hence, this website can speaks to users’ needs in its own way.

     A more comprehensive description of the targeted audiences could be— relatively young, familiar with internet, image-driven, can afford to dine out, lack of time and energy to spend on restaurants searching, curious, adventurous,  want to step out of comfort zones but not too far from it.
